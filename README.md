# Portable Pi global configuration

This repository is designed to be cloned as the portable Pi configuration tree:

```text
~/.pi
```

Pi's effective global agent directory is `~/.pi/agent`. The tracked
`agent/settings.json` is the sole settings file; package and skill paths resolve
relative to `agent/`. Its resource shims expose the repository's package sources,
skills, shared subagent definitions, and procedure library from that location.
Runtime state and credentials under `agent/` remain ignored.

Clone the whole tree to `~/.pi`. Cloning directly to `~/.pi/agent` no longer
provides settings at Pi's effective agent root.

Keep the root `AGENTS.md` filename uppercase; Pi loads it as global guidance.
`AGENTS.md` at the repository root is the sole source of global instructions.
`agent/AGENTS.md` is a regular Markdown pointer, not a symlink or duplicate: when
Pi loads it, the agent must read `../AGENTS.md` relative to that pointer file.
This avoids symlink privileges for instruction loading on Windows. Other
resource shims still use symlinks.

It combines portable Pi configuration with reusable agent materials and the
source of the local Pi packages enabled by `agent/settings.json`.

```

Pi ignores the extra reusable-material trees unless a package or setting refers
to them. Root `procedures/*.js` is reserved for executable saved `pi-procedure`
scripts; reusable Markdown procedures live in nested `procedures/<domain>/`
directories, which the procedure loader ignores.

## Repository guidance

This README is the source of truth for repository-specific layout and a high-level package
behavior overview. `agent/settings.json` is authoritative for activation, and
`configs/pi-agent/MANIFEST.md` is the complete enabled-package inventory. Before changing this repository's layout or active resources, read this README and
`configs/pi-agent/MANIFEST.md`. Then read the relevant package README, project documentation,
and every applicable nested `AGENTS.md` for the area involved. Do this automatically; do not
wait for the user to request documentation. These requirements apply only to work on this
repository, not unrelated projects.

The repository combines three roles:

- `agent/settings.json`, `keybindings.json`, `skills/`, and `subagents/` provide the
  active portable Pi configuration.
- `configs/pi-agent/packages/` contains the local Pi packages enabled by relative
  paths from `agent/settings.json` through the `agent/configs` shim.
- `codex/`, `configs/`, `mcp/`, `plans/`, `procedures/`, `skills/`, and
  `subagents/` hold reusable, project-agnostic materials.

Keep repository-owned directory names in lowercase hyphen-case. Preserve the
published casing of vendored assets and external specifications. Keep
host-specific tool configuration under `configs/` or `codex/configs/`; never
commit authentication data, session logs, caches, local history, runtime
databases, or other machine-local state.

`subagents/` is the single source of truth for production definitions shared by
Pi Subagents and Pi Teams. Do not create a separate root `teams/` definition
library. Local Codex plugin sources belong under
`codex/plugins/plugins/<plugin-name>/`, and marketplace-backed plugins use
`codex/plugins/marketplace.json`.

### Codex layout

- `codex/configs/` contains portable Codex configuration sources.
- `codex/plugins/marketplace.json` contains workspace marketplace metadata.
- `codex/plugins/plugins/<plugin-name>/` contains local plugin sources.

### PiAgent behavior

`configs/pi-agent/packages/` is the source of truth for active package-backed Pi
extensions. `agent/settings.json` enables them with portable relative paths, and
root `skills/` is the canonical global skill library.

- **Modes:** `pi-plan` provides unrestricted Off plus restricted Discuss, Plan,
  and Quick modes through `/discuss`, `/plan`, `/quick`, and the `Shift+Tab`
  cycle. Quick keeps concise read-only chat; Discuss adds normal-length read-only
  discussion; Plan uses tagged planning skills and an authorized `save_plan`
  path. Plan-mode workers are fresh read-only one-shot Pi Subagents. The shared
  base instructions live in `skills/plan/`.
- **MCP:** `pi-mcp-client` loads machine-local `mcp.json` stdio server
  definitions with a minimal environment. Calls confirm by default, large
  catalogs use `mcp_search_tools`, and session shutdown owns process cleanup.
  Remote HTTP and unsupported MCP capabilities are intentionally out of scope.
- **Codex helpers:** `pi-codex-web-search` and `pi-codex-image-generation` use
  short-lived Codex clients and the existing ChatGPT login. Image generation
  uses an ephemeral image-only thread, accepts explicit source images, and
  confines output writes to the current working directory.
- **Timers:** `pi-timers` provides main-agent-only in-process recurring timers.
  Ticks coalesce while the agent is busy, and timers disappear on cancellation,
  reload, session replacement, or process exit. `/timers` and `Alt+R` expose
  list/cancel controls.
- **Sessions:** `pi-clear`, `pi-sessions`, `pi-prune`, and `pi-handoff` provide `/clear`,
  `/sessions`, lifecycle-safe session replacement/removal, and fresh continuation sessions
  built from editable active-branch summaries.
- **Safety:** `pi-safety` gates agent-originated `bash` calls by category through
  `/safety off|on|max`, with local privacy-preserving audit state. It does not
  gate user-entered `!` commands.
- **Status UI:** `pi-git-status`, `pi-model-thinking`, `pi-tool-monitor`, and
  `pi-status-line` publish Git state, model/thinking, active tools, context,
  usage, and cost into the shared above-editor/footer UI. `/tools` opens the
  tool monitor and can abort the whole turn through `ctx.abort()`.
- **Subagents and procedures:** `pi-subagents` owns the main-agent worker tools
  and live tree. `pi-procedure` runs deterministic one-shot-agent orchestration
  scripts and exposes `/procedures`; its tree can be expanded with `Alt+E` and
  stopped with `Alt+W`.
- **Teams and merging:** `pi-teams` adds persistent team agents and optional peer
  messaging. `pi-merge` synthesizes selected session branches into a new session
  while leaving source branches intact.
- **User notices and turn statistics:** `pi-notify-user` renders structured
  end-of-turn notices with optional urgent toasts. `pi-turn-stats` emits a
  compact TUI-only notice after the agent truly settles; it does not alter the
  prompt or add model work.
- **Change tracking:** `pi-changes` records the main agent's successful
  `edit`/`write` touches with first-touch baselines. `/changes` provides
  git-independent diffs, file browsing, isolated read-only questions, and
  precise per-file undo where a safe baseline exists. Bash-made changes are out
  of scope.
- **Theme and keys:** `configs/pi-agent/packages/void-agent/themes/` contains the
  tracked theme family. `agent/settings.json` selects the active theme, and root
  `keybindings.json` assigns thinking/model cycling while reserving `Shift+Tab`
  for `pi-plan`.

Mutable extension settings and all session/runtime state remain ignored. Run
`/reload` or restart Pi after changing a package, skill, subagent definition,
keybinding, or theme.

## Fresh installation

Back up an existing Pi directory before replacing it. Do not copy its settings
file over this repository's portable settings.

Whole-tree install:

```bash
mv ~/.pi ~/.pi.backup
git clone <repository-url> ~/.pi
chmod 700 ~/.pi ~/.pi/agent
node ~/.pi/scripts/validate-global-config.mjs
```

Authenticate with `/login`. When migrating an existing installation, restore
only the machine-local state you intentionally preserved in the private backup;
keep it outside Git and retain its restrictive permissions.

Start Pi and run `/reload` after resource changes. The tested baseline is Pi
`0.83.0`; package features may also require Git, a Nerd Font, or the external
tools named in their package READMEs.

## Existing-machine cutover

1. Stop Pi processes.
2. Make a private backup of the complete existing `~/.pi` directory.
3. Preserve required machine-local state privately.
4. Clone this repository to an empty `~/.pi`.
5. Restore only the private state needed under `~/.pi/agent`; keep the portable
   tracked configuration from the clone.
6. Validate, start Pi, and keep the backup until resource discovery and normal
   operation are confirmed.

Rollback is a directory swap back to the private backup.

## Security boundary

Machine-local and sensitive state stays outside the tracked tree. Never weaken
the ignore boundary merely to preserve a mutable local file; use a sanitized
example when portable configuration is genuinely needed.

Pi can update `agent/settings.json` through interactive configuration. Review every
settings diff before committing and keep the tracked file portable.

## Validation

Run:

```bash
node scripts/validate-global-config.mjs
git diff --check
git status --short
```

The validator reads `agent/settings.json` and checks its portable package paths
and package manifests through `agent/configs`. It also checks JSON files,
resource directories, the canonical shared definition inventory, absence of the
legacy definition directory, linked-file safety, and the tracked-versus-local
boundary.

## Development

Active Pi packages remain under `configs/pi-agent/packages/` so their existing
tests and documentation stay stable. Project-specific implementation records go
under `configs/pi-agent/docs/agents/`; sanitized reusable extracts go into the
matching root shared-material directory.

No commit or push is performed automatically after configuration changes.
