# Standalone extension compatibility

## Scope

Pi 0.80.10 and 0.81.0 standalone Bun executables load extension dependencies
through a fixed virtual-module table. Package-root imports for Pi, Pi TUI, Pi AI, and
TypeBox work without an npm module tree. Arbitrary file-URL imports of private Pi
implementation files do not.

## Changes

Void Agent no longer derives private renderer module paths from the CLI entry
file. Its presentation shims now use class objects reachable from Pi's bundled
package-root export:

- The tool separator patches the root-exported `ToolExecutionComponent`.
- The working background intercepts the root-exported `InteractiveMode` host and
  decorates each working-indicator instance as Pi installs it.

This preserves the existing native status-container placement, tool rendering,
spacing, dividers, animated background, and Matrix layer in both npm and
standalone distributions. The private render shapes remain intentionally pinned
to the verified Pi versions, fail open, warn when unavailable, and restore on
shutdown. The config-alias trust-warning shim now follows the same restoration
lifecycle.

Child Pi launchers in the changes, commit, and merge packages now classify the
runtime from `process.execPath` before considering `process.argv[1]`. A compiled
executable therefore reinvokes itself directly regardless of Bun's virtual entry
path spelling; Node and Bun script runtimes continue to pass their real script
path.

## Pi 0.81.0 verification

Before extending the version allowlists, the v0.81.0 source was checked for the
same contracts: root exports for `InteractiveMode` and `ToolExecutionComponent`,
the host methods used by the guarded shims, the tool renderer's completion and
shell state, the working-indicator render contract, and the standalone loader's
package-root virtual module. The container digests were cross-checked against the
release's `SHA256SUMS` asset.

## Pi 0.83.0 renderer allowlist

Void Agent 1.0.3 adds Pi 0.83.0 to the exact allowlist for the tool-separator
and working-background renderer patches. The patches still verify their target
methods at runtime, fail open when a target is unavailable, and restore only the
functions they installed.

The regression suite exercises the shared renderer contracts against Pi 0.81.0
and simulates the 0.83.0 version gate. Pi 0.83.0 source was not independently
checked for this allowlist-only update; a live 0.83.0 `/reload` remains the final
compatibility check.

## Verification

Run:

```bash
node configs/pi-agent/packages/void-agent/test/working-background.test.mjs
node configs/pi-agent/packages/void-agent/test/tool-separator.test.mjs
node configs/pi-agent/packages/void-agent/test/config-alias-guard.test.mjs
node configs/pi-agent/test/standalone-invocation.test.mjs
```

Then test the configured TUI with the official standalone Pi 0.81.0 release.
The static tests prove shared root-export class identity and restoration; only a
real standalone TUI run verifies bundled-runtime behavior end to end.
