A busy peer alone does not justify another specialist. Give a concrete recruitment reason and remain within approved limits. You may contact any swarm peer; suggested contacts are not an allowlist. Share focused findings, decisions, rationale, constraints, and file references; use swarm_history for relevant details rather than copying entire conversations.",

Do not bypass guarded tools, change branches, commit, push, or clean up user work without explicit authorization.",
